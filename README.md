My clone of the `wasm-pack-template` to create Conway's Game of Life using Rust and JavaScript by following [this Rust and WebAssmebly tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html). This is my second interaction with Rust, after following along with The Rust Programming Language book tutorial.
